        <p>
          Giza is the second-largest city in Egypt after Cairo and
          fourth-largest city in Africa after Lagos, Kinshasa and Cairo. It is
          the capital of Giza Governate . Giza is located on the west bank of
          the Nile, 4.9 km southwest of central Cairo, and is a core city of
          the Greater Cairo metropolis. Giza is most famous as the location of
          the Giza Plateau, the site of the some of the most imporessive and
          ancient monuments in the world. Giza is a plateau southwest of modern Cairo
        which served as the necropolis for the royalty of the Old Kingdom of
        Egypt. Most famous for the pyramids of Khufu(completed in c. 2560
        BCE) and the Great Sphinx(built 2500 BCE).

    <h3>History</h3>

      <p>
            As ancient Egypt passed under several conquests under the
            Persians, Greeks, Romans and Byzantines, so did the area in what
            is now Giza. A Byzantine village named Phylake (Greek: Φυλακή)
            or Terso (Coptic: ϯⲣⲥⲱ, meaning "the fortress", now Tersa) was
            located south of Giza and should not be confused with
            it.Egyptians called the area Tipersis (Coptic:
            ϯⲡⲉⲣⲥⲓⲥ) (also Tipersis enbabylon (which most likely refers to
            Babylon Fortress but may as well refer to Babylon in
            Mesopotamia) Tipersoi, Perso), which may correspond to Persians
            (as the name may be literally translated as "Persians of/from
            Babylon").

          <p>
            Egyptian cuisine makes heavy use of legumes, vegetables and
            fruit from Egypt's rich Nile Valley and Delta. It shares
            similarities with the food of the Eastern Mediterranean region,
            such as rice-stuffed vegetables and grape leaves, hummus,
            falafel, shawarma, kebab and kofta. Examples of Egyptian dishes
            include ful medames, mashed fava beans; kushari, lentils and
            pasta; and molokhiya, bush okra stew. Pita bread, known locally
            as eish baladi is a staple of Egyptian cuisine, and cheesemaking
            in Egypt dates back to the First Dynasty of Egypt, with domty
            being the most popular type of cheese consumed today.

    <h3>Music</h3>

      <p>
        Music has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since
        antiquity in Egypt. Egyptian music had a significant impact on
        the development of ancient Greek music, and via the Greeks it
        was important to early European music well into the Middle Ages.
        Due to the thousands of years long dominance of Egypt over its
        neighbors, Egyptian culture, including music and musical
        instruments, was very influential in the surrounding regions;
        for instance, the instruments claimed in the Bible to have been
        played by the ancient Hebrews are all Egyptian instruments as
        established by Egyptian archaeology.
