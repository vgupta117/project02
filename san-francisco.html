                Perched atop hills and filled-in marshland at the entrance to
                one of the Pacific’s largest natural harbors, San Francisco has
                had an outsized influence on the history of California and the
                United States. Originally a Spanish (later Mexican) mission and
                pueblo, it was conquered by the United States in 1846 and by an
                invading army of prospectors following the 1848 discovery of
                gold in its hinterland. The Gold Rush made San Francisco a
                cosmopolitan metropolis with a frontier edge. The great 1906
                earthquake and fire destroyed much of the city but barely slowed
                its momentum; San Francisco barreled through the 20th century as
                a center of wealth, military power, progressive culture and high
                technology.

                The San Francisco sound refers to rock music performed live and
                recorded by San Francisco-based rock groups of the mid-1960s to
                early 1970s. It was associated with the counterculture community
                in San Francisco, particularly the Haight-Ashbury district,
                during these years.[1] San Francisco is a westward-looking port
                city, a city that at the time was 'big enough' but not manic
                like New York City or spread out like Los Angeles. Hence, it
                could support a 'scene'.[2] According to journalist Ed Vulliamy,
                "A core of Haight Ashbury bands played with each other, for each
                other"
