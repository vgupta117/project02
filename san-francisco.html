            and the fourth-largest by economic output, with GDP of $592 billion
            in 2019. With San Jose, it forms the fifth most populous combined
            statistical area in the United States, with 9.67 million residents

        <h3>History</h3>

        <p>
          Perched atop hills and filled-in marshland at the entrance to
          one of the Pacific’s largest natural harbors, San Francisco has
          had an outsized influence on the history of California and the
          United States. Originally a Spanish (later Mexican) mission and
          pueblo, it was conquered by the United States in 1846 and by an
          invading army of prospectors following the 1848 discovery of
          gold in its hinterland. The Gold Rush made San Francisco a
          cosmopolitan metropolis with a frontier edge. The great 1906
          earthquake and fire destroyed much of the city but barely slowed
          its momentum; San Francisco barreled through the 20th century as
          a center of wealth, military power, progressive culture and high
          technology.

        <h3>Music</h3>

        <p>
          The San Francisco sound refers to rock music performed live and
                recorded by San Francisco-based rock groups of the mid-1960s to
                early 1970s. It was associated with the counterculture community
                in San Francisco, particularly the Haight-Ashbury district,
                during these years.[1] San Francisco is a westward-looking port
                city, a city that at the time was 'big enough' but not manic
                like New York City or spread out like Los Angeles. Hence, it
                could support a 'scene'.[2] According to journalist Ed Vulliamy,
                "A core of Haight Ashbury bands played with each other, for each
                other"
