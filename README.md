4/2/2021:
    Bianca completed F-Layout for Giza citypage, removed Stats for each city (clashed with F-Layout), further edited the style and css for each, fixed header selection glitch (each city highlights properly when selected)
    
    Vikram updated three remaining pages following Bianca's work and published the cite to digital scholar
    
    Vikram added php includes for the navigation but kept them commented out due to the website not being php enabled yet.
    
    The team discussed the F-Pattern layout of the city pages and elected to make a few more changes to the layout to ensure the F-pattern follows the readers eye pattern. Before the heading was in position in the center of the block, and as such the reader's eyes would have met the middle of the box rather than the first sentence.  The edits were done by Jennifer and Bianca.

    We decided to use Open Sans typeface instead of Montserrat typeface as originally planned because the Montserrat letters were too wide and not as legible as we would have liked.  Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson, Type Director of Ascender Corp. This version contains the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance. It was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms. https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans#glyphs
