        <p>
          New York City (NYC), often called simply New York, is the most
          populous city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of
          the State of New York, the city is the center of the New York
          metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by
          urban landmass. New York City has been described as the cultural,
          financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing
          commerce,[13] entertainment, research, technology, education,
          politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the
          headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center
          for international diplomacy

        <h3>History</h3>

        <p>
          The "Sons of Liberty" campaigned against British authority in
          New York City, and the Stamp Act Congress of representatives
          from throughout the Thirteen Colonies met in the city in 1765 to
          organize resistance to Crown policies. The city's strategic
          location and status as a major seaport made it the prime target
          for British seizure in 1776. General George Washington lost a
          series of battles from which he narrowly escaped (with the
          notable exception of the Battle of Harlem Heights, his first
          victory of the war), and the British Army occupied New York and
          made it their base on the continent until late 1783, attracting
          Loyalist refugees. The city served as the national capital under
          the Articles of Confederation from 1785 to 1789, and briefly
          served as the new nation's capital in 1789–90 under the United
          States Constitution.

        <p>
          The cuisine of New York City comprises many cuisines belonging
          to various ethnic groups that have entered the United States
          through the city. Almost all ethnic cuisines are well
          represented in New York, both within and outside the various
          ethnic neighborhoods.[1] New York was also the founding city of
          New York Restaurant Week which has spread around the world due
          to the discounted prices that such a deal offers.[2] In New York
          there are over 12,000 bodegas, delis, and groceries, and many
          among them are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

        <p>
          The music of New York is a diverse and important field in the
          world of music. It has long been a thriving home for popular
          genres such as jazz, rock, soul music, R&B, funk, disco, and the
          urban blues, as well as classical and art music. It is the
          birthplace of hip hop, garage house, boogaloo, doo wop, bebop,
          New York punk rock, and US new wave. It's also the birthplace of
          salsa music, born from a fusion of Cuban and Puerto Rican
          influences that came together in New York's Latino neighborhoods
          in the 1960s. The city's culture, a melting pot of nations from
          around the world, has produced vital folk music scenes such as
          Irish-American music and Jewish klezmer.
