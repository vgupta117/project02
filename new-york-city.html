            New York City (NYC), often called simply New York, is the most
            populous city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of
            the State of New York, the city is the center of the New York
            metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by
            urban landmass. New York City has been described as the cultural,
            financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing
            commerce,[13] entertainment, research, technology, education,
            politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the
            headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center
            for international diplomacy

                The "Sons of Liberty" campaigned against British authority in
                New York City, and the Stamp Act Congress of representatives
                from throughout the Thirteen Colonies met in the city in 1765 to
                organize resistance to Crown policies. The city's strategic
                location and status as a major seaport made it the prime target
                for British seizure in 1776. General George Washington lost a
                series of battles from which he narrowly escaped (with the
                notable exception of the Battle of Harlem Heights, his first
                victory of the war), and the British Army occupied New York and
                made it their base on the continent until late 1783, attracting
                Loyalist refugees. The city served as the national capital under
                the Articles of Confederation from 1785 to 1789, and briefly
                served as the new nation's capital in 1789–90 under the United
                States Constitution.

                The cuisine of New York City comprises many cuisines belonging
                to various ethnic groups that have entered the United States
                through the city. Almost all ethnic cuisines are well
                represented in New York, both within and outside the various
                ethnic neighborhoods.[1] New York was also the founding city of
                New York Restaurant Week which has spread around the world due
                to the discounted prices that such a deal offers.[2] In New York
                there are over 12,000 bodegas, delis, and groceries, and many
                among them are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

                The music of New York is a diverse and important field in the
                world of music. It has long been a thriving home for popular
                genres such as jazz, rock, soul music, R&B, funk, disco, and the
                urban blues, as well as classical and art music. It is the
                birthplace of hip hop, garage house, boogaloo, doo wop, bebop,
                New York punk rock, and US new wave. It's also the birthplace of
                salsa music, born from a fusion of Cuban and Puerto Rican
                influences that came together in New York's Latino neighborhoods
                in the 1960s. The city's culture, a melting pot of nations from
                around the world, has produced vital folk music scenes such as
                Irish-American music and Jewish klezmer.
