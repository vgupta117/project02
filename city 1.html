              <strong>History</strong>
              <p>
                As ancient Egypt passed under several conquests under the
                Persians, Greeks, Romans and Byzantines, so did the area in what
                is now Giza. A Byzantine village named Phylake (Greek: Φυλακή)
                or Terso (Coptic: ϯⲣⲥⲱ, meaning "the fortress", now Tersa) was
                located south of Giza and should not be confused with
                it.[8][9][10] Egyptians called the area Tipersis (Coptic:
                ϯⲡⲉⲣⲥⲓⲥ) (also Tipersis enbabylon (which most likely refers to
                Babylon Fortress but may as well refer to Babylon in
                Mesopotamia) Tipersoi, Perso), which may correspond to Persians
                (as the name may be literally translated as "Persians of/from
                Babylon").[11][12] Eutychius gives a legend about city's name
                and its foundation by Artaxerxes Ochus, while Abu Salih says it
                was found by a Persian king Hūš at the same time as Qasr
                ash-Sham.[13]

              <strong>Cuisine</strong>
              <p>
                Egyptian cuisine makes heavy use of legumes, vegetables and
                fruit from Egypt's rich Nile Valley and Delta. It shares
                similarities with the food of the Eastern Mediterranean region,
                such as rice-stuffed vegetables and grape leaves, hummus,
                falafel, shawarma, kebab and kofta. Examples of Egyptian dishes
                include ful medames, mashed fava beans; kushari, lentils and
                pasta; and molokhiya, bush okra stew. Pita bread, known locally
                as eish baladi is a staple of Egyptian cuisine, and cheesemaking
                in Egypt dates back to the First Dynasty of Egypt, with domty
                being the most popular type of cheese consumed today.

              <strong>Music</strong>
              <p>
                Music has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since
                antiquity in Egypt. Egyptian music had a significant impact on
                the development of ancient Greek music, and via the Greeks it
                was important to early European music well into the Middle Ages.
                Due to the thousands of years long dominance of Egypt over its
                neighbors, Egyptian culture, including music and musical
                instruments, was very influential in the surrounding regions;
                for instance, the instruments claimed in the Bible to have been
                played by the ancient Hebrews are all Egyptian instruments as
                established by Egyptian archaeology.
