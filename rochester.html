            Rochester is a city in the U.S. state of New York, the seat of
            Monroe CountyThe city of Rochester forms the core of a much larger
            metropolitan area with a population of around 1.1 million people,
            across six counties. Rochester was one of the United States' first
            boomtowns, initially due to the fertile Genesee River Valley, which
            gave rise to numerous flour mills, and then as a manufacturing
            center, which spurred further rapid population growth. The city rose
            to prominence as the birthplace and home of some of America's most
            iconic companies, by which the region became a global center for
            science, technology, and research and development.

                Settlement began in the late 18th century, and the city
                flourished with the opening of the Erie Canal. It became a major
                manufacturing center, and attracted many Italians, Germans,
                Irish and other immigrants, as well as a dominant group of
                Yankees of New England origin. The Yankees made Rochester the
                center of multiple reform movements, such as abolitionism and
                women's rights. It was famous as the center of the American
                photography industry, with headquarters of Eastman Kodak. In the
                1970s it became fashionable to call the industrial cities along
                the Great Lakes 'rustbelt cities' following the move away from
                steel, chemical and other hard goods manufacturing. Rochester,
                with the presence of Ritter-Pfaulder, Bausch and Lomb, Eastman
                Kodak, Xerox, Gannett and other major industries, defied the
                trend for many decades following WWII.

                One food product Rochester calls its own is the "white hot", a
                variant of the hot dog or smoked bratwurst made by the local
                Zweigle's company and other companies.[97][98] Another local
                specialty is the "Garbage Plate", a trademark of Nick Tahou Hots
                that traditionally includes macaroni salad, home fries, and two
                hot dogs or cheeseburgers topped with mustard, onions, and their
                famous meat hot sauce. Many area restaurants feature copies or
                variations with the word "plate" commonly used as a general
                term. Rochester was home to French's Mustard, whose address was
                1 Mustard Street
